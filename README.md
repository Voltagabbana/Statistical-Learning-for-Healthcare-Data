# Myocardial Infarction Prediction
Project of the master Course "Statistical Learning for Healthcare Data" from Politecnico di Milano.

## Introduction
Myocardial infarction (MI) is a term for an event of heart attack. MI occurs when blood stops flowing properly to
a part of the heart and the heart muscle gets injured because of lack of oxygen supply, leading to possible necrosis
if reperfusion of the organ is not performed in short times. Despite the remarkable advances in its treatment,
MI remains a very dangerous disease and the most common cause of heart failure. It is widely spread in all
countries, especially in the developed ones where people are more exposed to chronic stress and unhealthy
lifestyles. The course of MI in patients is very diverse, thus it is very difficult to foresee the development of
complications which can even lead to death.
In the present study, we analyse a database collected in the Krasnoyarsk Interdistrict Clinical Hospital in
Russia between 1992 and 1995 with the goal to present a model able to classify a patient in two categories:
dead or alive. We also want to show how the classification changes if we consider only the information obtained
when they are admitted and those collected in the three days of hospitalisation.
